# The Wind Engine
This is my oldest game engine, it's a 3D OpenGL game engine contains a physics engine, collision detection and resolution. Most of the physics it to do with constraints and forces, along with linear and angular acceleration for objects in 3D. This engine is no longer in development and all the work I've put in will hopefully be in a new engine I'm developing privately. I keep semi-regular updates on my game development journey on my YouTube channel [EscPointDev](https://www.youtube.com/@EscPointDev) So if you are more interested in further details about what I'm doing and I'm doing check out a video.
